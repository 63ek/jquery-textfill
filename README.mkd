jQuery TextFill
===============

It resizes text to fit into a container and makes font size as big as possible.

This jQuery plugin was created by Russ Painter around May 2009, beginning with a StackOverflow [question][soq]. In very early 2012, Yu-Jie Lin helped to move the project to GitHub with version 0.1 and obtained the clearly stated open source licensing from Russ.

Usage
-----

    <script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script src="http://jquery-textfill.github.com/jquery-textfill/jquery.textfill.min.js"></script>

The code above uses minified version. By default options, you need to put text inside of `<span/>`:

    <div class='textfill' style='width:100px;height:50px;'>
      <span>The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</span>
    </div>

Initializing the plugin:

    <script>
    $(function(){
      $('.textfill').textfill({ maxFontPixels: 36 });
    });
    </script>
